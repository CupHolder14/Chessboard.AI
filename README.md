### Welcome to our AI Chess Board Project!

The goal here is to create a physical chess board with integrated magnetic sensors and LEDs that allow a player to challenge an AI on a real board. 
Upon making a move, the AI will use a number of techniques to efficiently analyze the best possible move it can make, and the board will convey the AI's intention with a
series of colour coordinated light indicators!
